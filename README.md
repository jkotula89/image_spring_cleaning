# Image Spring Cleaning
Did you ever take duplicate photos just to make sure, that a moment does not only remain a souvenir of your mind but an array of shape (n,m,3) as well?

After the holiday, you might face the same challenge as I do (especially if you have a loose finger on the trigger):

  __which images to keep vs. which images to delete safely__

This fine little word safely can be interpreted in different ways and we will come to that in a minute. For the time being, I would like to identify images that
* are duplicates of one and the same scenery (or are at least very similar)
* keep only the best image of each group (most sharp)

At a later stage, I would like to extent the distinctive capabilities of the algorithm and pay more attention to images that focus on persons.
