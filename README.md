Did you ever take duplicate photos just to make sure, that a moment does not only remain a souvenir of your mind but an array of shape (n,m,3) as well?

After the holidy, you might face the same challenge as I do (especially if you have a loose finger on the trigger): 
which images to keep vs. which images to delete safely?

This fine little word safely can be interpreted in different ways. For the time being, I would like to identify images that
* are duplicates of one and the same scenery (or very similar)
* keep only the image of each group, that is most sharp

At a later stage, I would like to extent the distinctive capabilities and be more cautious with images containing people.
